This is code for an LSI-11 emulation written by Bob Meister and published in the July 1996 issue (#72) of Circuit Cellar. 
The code was not published in the article but was available for download. It's designed to be built for an MS-DOS
target, so I'm using Open Watcom 1.9 running on Windows 3.1 running on DOSBox.

While the code compiles and runs, and the ODT prompt is received, at this point I cannot get RT-11 to run. I suspect
that Bob had a custom version of RT-11 which contained a custom DX (RX11) driver.
